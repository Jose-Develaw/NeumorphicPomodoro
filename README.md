# NeumorphicPomodoro

## Yet another pomodoro app

There are a bunch of pomodoro apps out there. Why in hell would you develop another one? Well the reason is simple: 
This app was made as part of the MoureDev's (by [Brais Moure](https://mouredev.com)) awesome community [Monthly Challenge](https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022) (April 22')

## How is it done?

This challenge gave me the opportunity of develop some skills, both at the coding and designing levels. So, you will find:

### Design:

- **Neumorphic Styling** -> This app is for you to concentrate. I don't want the colors and shapes to distract you. Thus, I think neumorphism is a great fit.
- **Native UX** -> Taking into account this is a natively developed app, I decided to constrain myself to the native experience as much as I could. This is why I have used sheets, native navigation, edit buttons for deleting items in rows...

### Coding:

- **SwiftUI** -> New boy in the block. I am enjoying a lot the learning process.
- **Combine** -> Used for building smarter timers.
- **CoreData** -> Persistence the powerful way. Used for storing your sessions details.
- **UserDefaults and Codable** -> For keeping track of your settings.

## Known issues

- Counter's Arc doesn't resize properly when it is needed to shrink (iPhone SE / iPhone 8)

## Work in progress

- Achieve automatic scrolling titles when task names are longer than available space (teleprompter effect)

## Next releases' goals

- Dark mode
- Multiple Device history synchro via CloudKit
- MacOS support
